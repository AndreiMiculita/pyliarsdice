The game consists of multiple rounds. In every round, all players throw their dices under the cup, such that the dices are only visible to themselves. Following, one of the players (in particular, the player who has lost the previous round) starts with a bid. In a clock-wise fashion, we go to the next players turn.
Except for the first turn in the round, every player has a choice between two types of actions:
* Overbid the previous player - overbidding means that either the number of dices is higher than the bid of the previous player, or the value of the dice is higher with the same number of dices as the previous player.
* Overbidding with Joker dices - a joker dice counts as double the number of dices when it's used as a bid. This is because every other value has a double chance of appearing on the table (since a joker also counts towards their number), while the joker itself is only based on the probability of appearing itself.
A bid can be anything, independently of the roll of dices under the cup. This means bluffing is a substantial part of this game and can be strategically used to cause other players to lie.
* Calling the previous player a liar - whenever you believe that the bid of the previous player is a lie (i.e. the number of dices of the bid is not on the table), you can call that player a liar.
At the point that someone has performed the action of calling the previous player a liar, every player has to specify whether he or she believes that the number of dices of the bid is on the table or not, in a clock-wise fashion. Following, everyone opens their cup and the dices are counted and compared to the bid.
If the number of the bid is equal or less than the number of dices on the table, the bid is correct. However, if the number of the bid is greater than the number of the dices on the table, the bid is a lie. All the players who are correct lose one die.
After this the round has ended. A new round starts with the remaining number of dices for each player, restarting the bidding with the player who lost the last round. For multiple players, this will be the person who was either correctly called a liar, or the player who incorrectly called another player a liar.
After every round, all the players who were correct lose a die. The goal is to be the first to lose all of the dices from your cup. However, the game will be played until all players except one have no more dices remaining their cups.
