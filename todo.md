|Create Reasoning text file for every ACT-R agent (concatenate strings of text). Make available as option to show  |  done   |
|Highlight dice correctly in final dice count (now todo: add for human player).                                    |  done   |
|Also add button or click to continue for user after game is finished, such that it has time to count              |  done   |
|Enemy bet not always shown (fixed I think)                                                                        |  done   |
|Feedback on disallowed actions, show what is not allowed (and maybe what would be)                                |  done   |
|Highlighting human dice                                                                                           |  done   |
|Increase time with nr of chunks                                                                                   |  done   |
|Feedback / click to continue in final count                                                                       |  done   |
|Add text space in the middle of the screen, showing the count of final round and who were correct (and lose a die)|  done   |
|Add reasoning files for cognitive model                                                                           |  done   |
|look into processing power of rolling animations (maybe cut the dice and keep only rolling GIF)                   |  done   |
|Add exclamation mark and  checkmark to buttons                                                                    |  done   |
|Make the buttons more of a square instead of long stretches (if possible), scale icon accordingly                 |  done   |
|Credit images (of dice and gifs etc)                                                                              |  done   |
|Update how to play                                                                                                |  done   |
|Convert reasoning string to StringIO                                                                              |  done   |
|Remove click to continue button (and maybe add something on the process bar such as 'Next round starting..')      |  done   |
|Make reasoning file scrollable                                                                                    |  done   |
|Change 'player 0' to 'You' in UI                                                                                  |  done   |
|Remove process bar and 'starting next round' when the next round has started (e.g. change to 'waiting'). Now it's weird since it still says waiting for next round, while opponents are already bidding            |    |
|Fix that you can go back from game (if you click reasoning tab from how to play or vice versa)                    |         |
|Color the opponents (i.e. title or groupbox) according to the color in playercolors (such that it corresponds with reasoning text) |   done    |
|The reasoning tab now cuts lines weird (for me). Maybe make it wider                                           | |
|'B' hotkey not working (for me at least)                                 | |
|The info text in the game is now the same font as 'playing against cognitive models'. Would be nice to have one in another font. (or put the info in a box?)                             | |
|I was thinking, maybe during the end of a round when the dice are counted, it would be nice to show which players were correct/wrong by changing their border colors temporarily to red/green                        | |
